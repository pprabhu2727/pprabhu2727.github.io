								<h3>The Requirements of the Project</h3>
								<p>The client needs a user-friendly website for their financial coaching business. 
									The website needs to be both ADA-compliant and mobile-friendly. 
									The website must incorporate a system that allows the client to update it as required and provide basic maintenance features. 
									The website must include interactive forms for customers; a customer account portal will facilitate submitting these forms. 
									The account portal will allow customers to fill out and submit forms and have an inbox, making sending and receiving messages from the client easy and accessible. 
									The portal will enable customers to create and view their appointments. 
									An appointment will be made through the website's calendar and scheduling page.
								</p>
								<p>
									The website will also need to provide a system for processing payments. 
									This system needs to be both accessible and secure. 
									Security of the client's and customer's financial data is critical. 
									Keeping this information safe is a top priority for building the payment system. 
									Additionally, the client needs a company email address. 
									The team will set up an email address related to the business's name and website. 
									Lastly, the client needs a data management system. This system is separate from the website and is accessible only by the client. 
									The system will capture analytics about traffic to the website, including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and birthday information where available. 
									This system will need to generate reports for the client.
